                                Far beyond in the silent vastness of the Milky Way, space itself tore open with a violent rupture. 
                                Through this gaping rift, a chaotic scene emerged, a realm consumed by endless fire, cascading meteors, 
                                and shattered planets adrift in oceans of molten lava. The edges of the rip pulsed with crimson cracks, 
                                glowing like the wounds of the universe itself.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                From within this infernal realm, enormous chunks of rock tumbled forward. Among them were fragments of 
                                something far more terrifying - broken pieces of a colossal being, its form so massive it dwarfed entire moons. 
                                Its body, torn apart and smouldering, fell through the breach. Then, as suddenly as it had opened, the rip sealed 
                                shut, vanishing without a trace, as if reality had simply mended its scar.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The debris hurtled forward through space, locked on a path towards a small blue world brimming with life. 
                                The moon took the first blows, absorbing some of the incoming fragments in silent sacrifice. But the bulk of the 
                                ruin rained down on the Earth, a planet alive with the thundering footsteps of dinosaurs. The sky burned red as 
                                meteors smashed into the ground, unleashing storms of fire and ash. Entire continents were scorched, the oceans 
                                boiled along their edges, and the era of the dinosaurs began to end in screams and silence.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Yet within this devastation, something unseen took root. Hidden deep within the debris lay an ancient essence, a 
                                force beyond science comprehension. As the meteors embedded themselves into the earth, the essence seeped out, 
                                weaving through the scorched lands. It infected many of the few creatures that clung to life in the aftermath, 
                                binding with them in secrecy.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                For millions of years, this essence remained dormant, fading slowly as time marched on, its power diminishing with 
                                each passing era. By the time humanity emerged, only fragments of it remained, slumbering within scattered bloodlines 
                                across the world. It lay hidden, silent, and forgotten, until the final few thousand years, when its quiet pulse began 
                                to stir once more within the hearts of the few that had the essence in them.

                        <div class="accordion-panel">
                            <p>The morning sun shone softly over the towering glass windows of New York University’s Silver Center for Chemistry, its golden light filtering into one of the fourth-floor labs. The room was quiet, almost sacred in its silence. Long polished benches lined the space, their dark surfaces etched with faint scars of experiments past, each table gleaming under the harsh white glow of fluorescent lights. Rows of brown chemical bottles stood neatly on steel racks, labelled in crisp handwriting, while a faint scent of ethanol, metal, and old stone drifted lazily through the cool air.</p>

                            <p>At the very front, sitting perfectly still, was Khan.</p>

                            <p>He sat alone, his posture rigid, his eyes focused on an open notebook filled with delicate lines of equations and meticulous notes. The sleeves of his grey sweater were rolled just past his wrists, revealing pale, a little ashy thin forearms . In his right hand, a black pen rested lightly between his fingers, tapping against the page in an anxious, rhythmic pulse. His thick black unstyled hair  was a little bit unusual for him but it also showed signs that his entire person is deeply buried in a subject that he must conquer first., his been up all night which gives him a tired but youthful look.</p>

                            <p>Khan was always early. Earlier than the janitors who mopped the linoleum floors before dawn. Earlier than the professors who taught in the labs. Over time, he had earned an unspoken reputation: brilliant, unapproachable, silent, a living shadow that neither spoke nor smiled without purpose. As he sat there, he places both palms on his table, his face giving a serious and curious look with his mind wondering in thoughts.  Then a sudden interruption. Professor Robbin had just walked into the class as his usual time of 7:55 am.</p>

                            <p>Professor Robbin, a man in his mid forties obsessed with his wife, who also lectures at the same university, his gentle face framed by thin reading glasses and a neatly trimmed beard. His well tailored outfit covered by his spotless white lab coat.</p>

                            <p>He paused when he saw Khan sitting alone at the front bench and nodded softly to himself with a small, approving smile.</p>

                            <p>“Morning, Khan,” he said warmly, placing his leather briefcase on the front table before setting up his laptop and lecture notes.</p>

                            <p>“Good morning” Khan replied, his voice quiet yet sharp, like the edge of a scalpel.</p>

                            <p>Slowly, the rest of the class began to arrive. The silence of the room melted into a growing hum of chatter and laughter as students poured in with steaming coffee cups, clinking thermos lids, and breakfast muffins wrapped in brown paper bags.</p>

                            <p>Two of the last to arrive were Amie and Lanre. Amie, her long blonde hair tied in a loose ponytail, wore a sweater draped casually over ripped jeans. Her bright blue eyes sparkled with sleepy excitement as she clung to Lanre’s arm, giggling at his whispered jokes. Lanre, tall and broad-shouldered and tightly braided hair, wore a navy hoodie with ‘NYU Chemistry Club’ printed in bold white across his chest. His phone buzzed constantly in his hand between steps.</p>

                            <p>“We will have dinner with my fam tonight, right?” Lanre asked, nudging her softly as they entered the lab.</p>

                            <p>Amie sighed playfully. “Anything for you!” she replied, rolling her eyes with a smile.</p>

                            <p>They made their way to the front of the class, stopping abruptly when they saw Khan occupying their usual seats. Amie pouted dramatically, widening her blue eyes at him like a pleading child.</p>

                            <p>“Khan,” she said with an exaggerated sweetness, “please, can we sit there? You know, I haven’t gotten my replacement glasses yet, and I won’t be able to see the board from the back.”</p>

                            <p>Professor Robbin, overhearing as he connected the projector cables, glanced up.</p>

                            <p>“Khan, be a gentleman today, hmm?” he said kindly. “Just for Amie’s eyes.”</p>

                            <p>For a moment, Khan didn’t move. His pen slipped from his fingers and clattered onto the table. He sat frozen, lips parted as though he were trying to form words he had never practised saying. His chest tightened with sudden panic, and the light around him seemed to dim into a narrow tunnel.</p>

                            <p>Lanre raised an eyebrow at Khan’s reaction, surprised by the depth of his visible distress. Amie’s face softened with guilt, realising her small request had caused unexpected pain.</p>

                            <p>“It’s okay, man,” Lanre said, trying to comfort him with a warm smile. “You’ve already aced this class anyway.”</p>

                            <p>Professor Robbin chuckled softly. “He’s right, Khan.”</p>

                            <p>Khan swallowed hard, his throat dry as he stood up silently. He can’t believe he will have to leave this seat which at that moment meant the world to him but he knew there’s no way to explain it why and no one will understand. He scanned the room, realising that every seat was taken except for one at the very back. The walk felt like a journey across a vast distance as he moved past his classmates, clutching his notebook tightly to his chest, his heart pounding in his ears.</p>

                            <p>He took the seat at the back, placing his notebook neatly on the worn wooden table. From here, the front of the room seemed distant, the students reduced to small, bobbing silhouettes. But Khan wasn’t looking at the professor.</p>

                            <p>His gaze was locked on his former seat. He’s attention to the seat was so intense he mentally drowned out all the professor and chatter from his classmates in the lab.</p>

                            <p>He continued to stared at it with an intensity that continued to burned away everything, the little rattle from the window, birds chirping on the trees near by and footsteps from the hallway. It felt as though his very very existence was tethered to that seat by invisible threads, each pulling at his chest with painful insistence. As Amie and Lanre leaned close, whispering about their plans, their laughter weaving softly through the lab, Khan barely registered their joy. All he saw was the vacant memory of himself sitting there, where he felt grounded and certain.</p>

                            <p>A student in front of him shifted their seat, blocking his view. Panic flickered in Khan’s eyes. He leaned sideways, ducking his head desperately to the side, trying to keep his former seat in sight. Within his subconscious, the world around him slowed to a crawl. Every sound stretched into echoing fragments, each movement reduced to a silent dance in slow motion as he strained to hold onto that fragile vision.</p>

                            <p>Then an absolute silence within his mind.</p>

                            <p>Then, without warning, the world ended.</p>

                            <p>Suddenly he sees a giant fireball from an explosion within the class quickly approaching him. His eyes opens wide as he knows his next. Everything and everyone behind the fireball is gone. He alone has a reaction to the fireball as everyone else is paused in time doing different actions before the pause in time. Khan noticed two of his classmates smiling at each other during a discussion they were having, another was in the process of a prank on another student but now no one will in the class will know what happened before and after. Time resumes.</p>

                            <p>A deafening blast ripped through the lab. The ground convulsed beneath him as fire and smoke consumed everything. Glass shattered, tables splintered, and walls exploded outward with violent force. Screams mixed with the roar of destruction as the lab floor collapsed into the lower level, burying bodies beneath mountains of debris, smoke, and flame. The hallway wasn’t spared as fire blast though it consuming all that innocently opened walked by.</p>

                            <p>Its lights out for everyone in an instant.</p>

                            <p>Some time has passed, khan mind seems to be still active as he realises even as he sees nothing but darkness. He thinks this must be the after life or maybe the mind stays active after death but he starts hearing noises, then starts feeling pain. He opens his eyes over bright hospital lights blurred overhead. More pain coursed through his limbs like electricity, each breath jagged and raw. Around him hovered masked doctors and nurses, their urgent voices muffled by the blood rushing through his ears.</p>

                            <p>Through the chaos, he saw his mother, tears streaking down her anguished face as she reached for him. Behind her, his father stood trembling, arguing with hospital staff who blocked his way.</p>

                            <p>“Please… that’s my son… let me see him!” his father’s voice cracked with desperation.</p>

                            <p>The gurney wheeled forward and the doors swung shut, cutting off his parents from view. As Khan drifted into darkness, memories flooded his fading mind, moments of silent victory, near-death escapes, and the fragile certainty of an ordinary seat at the front of a chemistry lab at NYU.</p>

                            <p>The professor, Lanre, Amie, and the entire class had perished in the blast. Khan was the only survivor, his body in pain and with burn injuries but clinging to life. The collapse of the floor had killed and injured others in the building as well. He now remembers some seconds after the blast, he hears survivors’ screams faintly, mixing with the beeping monitors around.</p>

                            <p>He looked up at the bright hospital light as doctors and nurses surrounded him, their faces blurred and moving in quick, silent urgency.</p>

                            <p>Through the haze of pain and fading light, one quiet thought rose above everything else.</p>

                            <p>Hmm, am I still alive?</p>

                            <p>khan closes his eyes and smiles a little. Very odd of him.</p>

                        <div class="accordion-panel">
                            <p>Memories flickered through Khan’s mind like fading film reels as he slips in and out of consciousness. He sees blurred images of childhood moments.</p>

                            <p>He remembered being six years old, visiting his uncle’s chicken farm in Kaduna, a northern city in Nigeria. Khan is the older of two brothers, born and raised in the US. He and his brother James made frequent trips between two worlds, America’s neat suburban streets and Nigeria’s bustling cities and quiet villages. His mother, Itohan, was from the river-rich lands of the south, her voice melodic with gentle authority. His father, Gana, was from the north.</p>

                            <p>That morning at the farm, the sun glared down harshly on the corrugated iron roofs of the coops, casting long shadows across the dusty yard. They had arrived early, and the air still smelled fresh with damp earth and chicken feed. The family walked out of the small farm office together, his father chatting animatedly with Uncle Kwari about expanding his investments into poultry.</p>

                            <p>As the adults talked, Khan and James slipped away like restless shadows. James and Khan split up as they ran around. Khan’s small flip-flops slapping against the dirt pathway as he passed rows of wire cages stacked in neat blocks. Inside them, hundreds of hens clucked and flapped, their noise rising into a chaotic symphony of feathers and screeches. The air inside the main coop was thick with heat and the sharp tang of ammonia, making his eyes sting. Dust motes floated lazily through streaks of golden sunlight that poured in through small windows lined with chicken wire.</p>

                            <p>He slowed his steps as he reached the brooding section – a quieter area partitioned off from the main cages. Here, newly hatched chicks clustered together under the warm glow of hanging heat lamps. Their tiny beaks chirped softly as they huddled on straw-covered floors, their downy yellow feathers trembling with life. Khan squatted beside the pen, reaching his finger in to gently stroke one chick’s soft back. The little creature peeped and stumbled awkwardly away, Khan looked at the chick with a dead face interest and he begins to ponder.</p>

                            <p>Meanwhile, James was on the far side of the yard chasing a small herd of skinny goats. The goats bleated loudly, their hooves clacking against the concrete as they scattered away from his giggling pursuit. Dust rose around his feet as he ran, his laughter mingling with the distant calls of farmworkers unloading sacks of feed from a rusted pickup truck.</p>

                            <p>“Hey, Khan! Look at me, I’m a lion chasing them!” James yelled proudly, baring his teeth and leaping towards the goats.</p>

                            <p>But Khan wasn’t paying attention. Something had firmly caught his attention at the brooding section. Near a cement water trough sat a shallow blue plastic basket, half-submerged in water that shimmered with ripples of reflected light. Inside the basket lay several tiny chicks, their soaked feathers plastered to their limp bodies. Their beady black eyes were closed, their fragile forms unmoving.</p>

                            <p>With a blank stare of interest Khan tilted his head slightly, as he tried to ponder on the feelings he was getting from what he was seeing. James noticed his brother’s stillness and slowed his playful chase, curiosity pushing him back towards the brooding area. As he drew closer, he saw what Khan was staring at, and his laughter died in his throat.</p>

                            <p>“Mum! Uncle kwari!” James yelled out suddenly, his voice cracking.</p>

                            <p>Their mother and uncle, who had been walking nearby inspecting rows of feed bags, turned sharply towards the sound of James’ voice. Within moments, they were at their boys’ side.</p>

                            <p>Itohan bent down quickly, wrapping one arm around Khan’s small shoulders and pulling James close with her other hand. Her eyes softened with sadness as she saw the drowned chicks floating lifeless in the basket. Uncle Kwari frowned deeply, scratching his greying beard with confusion.</p>

                            <p>He lifted the edge of the basket, tilting it slightly to let some of the water spill out onto the packed earth.</p>

                            <p>“I’ll ask one of the farmhands what happened here,” Uncle Kwari said, his brow furrowed as he turned to Itohan. “This is strange. The baskets shouldn’t be near the water trough at all.”</p>

                            <p>Itohan nodded softly, her gaze returning to her sons. She pulled them both into her lap as she knelt on the dusty ground, hugging their small bodies against her chest. James leaned into her warmth, as she whispered gently in his ear.</p>

                            <p>“It’s okay, baby.”</p>

                            <p>Khan sniffed and wiped his nose with the back of his hand, still staring at the basket. His brown eyes flicked up to James’s face, seeing his brother’s confusion slowly turn into quiet sadness.</p>

                            <p>Later that afternoon, they sat in the backseat of their parents’ SUV, parked under the shade of a tree as their father said his final goodbyes to Uncle Kwari. The windows were cracked open, letting in the hot Kaduna breeze and the distant hum of insects.</p>

                            <p>James turned to Khan, his voice low and serious. “You think they were scared when they drowned?”</p>

                            <p>Khan’s eyes stayed locked on the road ahead, his small fingers tracing circles on his faded denim shorts. “I don’t know, but they struggled…so maybe,” he whispered.</p>

                            <p>“I hope it didn’t hurt,” James replied, his voice breaking softly.</p>

                            <p>Khan didn’t answer. He simply rested his head against the seat, staring blankly as the dusty farm road stretched away before them, leading towards Abuja and a future neither of them could yet imagine.</p>

                            <p>Outside, their parents finished talking and began walking towards the car. Khan closed his eyes. Coming back to the present day. Khan opens his eyes once again as the doctors and nurses scramble around him. He frowns at the memory he just relived. Before falling back unconscious.</p>

                        <div class="accordion-panel">
                            <p>Down memory lane again a few years after the chicken farm incident, Khan was nine years old. It was a late summer afternoon on the quiet tree-lined streets of Riverdale, their upscale neighbourhood in the Bronx. His parents were upper-middle-class professionals; their home was a red-brick two-storey townhouse with white-framed windows and a neatly trimmed lawn out front.</p>

                            <p>Children’s laughter echoed faintly from nearby backyards, blending with the chirping of sparrows perched on rusted chain-link fences. Khan and his brother James were playing tag, weaving between the cars like shadows slipping through dusk.</p>

                            <p>James’ laughter rang out clear and high as he darted away from Khan’s outstretched hands, his sandals slapping against the cracked pavement. Their game had spilled into the street’s parked rows, zigzagging between dusty bumpers and chrome-plated grilles. Each parked car was like an iron wall to them, their small bodies slipping effortlessly between spaces too tight for grownups.</p>

                            <p>It was Khan’s turn to tag James. He moved with quick, calculated steps, eyes narrowed in playful determination as sweat trickled down the side of his temple. The rhythmic thud of his heartbeat pulsed loudly in his ears. Ahead, James ducked behind a green SUV, giggling uncontrollably as he peeked around to check his brother’s position.</p>

                            <p>In the distance, Khan caught sight of a black sedan turning onto their street. It moved too fast for the neighbourhood’s usual quiet pace, tires humming low against the asphalt. Khan frowned slightly, his mind processing it even as his feet kept moving. From their height, neither he nor James could be seen by the driver – the rows of cars acting as visual barricades between them and the approaching danger.</p>

                            <p>Khan cornered James between two parked cars, a mischievous grin spreading across his face.</p>

                            <p>“Got you now!” he yelled, lunging forward.</p>

                            <p>James let out a squeal and darted away, his only escape route leading directly into the street.</p>

                            <p>Everything happened in a blink.</p>

                            <p>James sprinted out from between the cars, his skinny legs pumping fast. As he burst into the open lane, his eyes widened at the sudden sight of the black sedan bearing down on him. The sun glared against its windshield, making the driver’s face invisible. Time seemed to freeze as the car closed in with terrifying speed.</p>

                            <p>Khan lunged after him, arms outstretched. James planted his right feet in the ground stopping his motion but felt impeded from leaning back in his attempt to avoid getting run over by the car. Finally James felt a pulling force as khan yanked him back with all the strength his small body could muster. The momentum pulled James sharply towards him, just as the car’s front bumper grazed James’ elbow, pushing him slightly sideways but causing no real harm.</p>

                            <p>The sedan screeched to a violent halt, its tires burning black streaks into the road as the smell of scorched rubber filled the air. James stumbled backwards, crashing into Khan, who fell onto the sidewalk with James landing on top of him. james panted heavily, his heart hammering against his chest.</p>

                            <p>For a moment, there was only silence. The street held its breath.</p>

                            <p>Then everything erupted at once.</p>

                            <p>The car door flew open and a young man in his twenties jumped out, his face pale with shock as he sprinted around the back of his car.</p>

                            <p>“ARE YOU ALRIGHT?” he shouted, his voice cracking with panic.</p>

                            <p>At the same moment, Itohan, khan and james mum, had just stepped out onto the front porch, carrying a basket of folded laundry. She froze, her eyes wide in horror as she saw Khan pulling James back from the street, the car stopped inches away from where they lay.</p>

                            <p>Her basket fell to the ground, clothes scattering across the porch tiles as she bolted forward, screaming in fury and fear.</p>

                            <p>“YOU WANT TO KILL MY BOYS!” she shouted at the driver, her voice trembling with rage as tears welled in her eyes.</p>

                            <p>“I’m so sorry – I didn’t see them – they just ran out!” the driver stammered, his hands raised in frantic apology, his gaze darting between Itohan and the two boys.</p>

                            <p>James pushed himself off Khan’s chest, breathing hard, his small shoulders heaving. He turned to look at Khan with narrowed eyes, his face twisted with an emotion Khan couldn’t quite read. Anger? Fear? Betrayal?</p>

                            <p>Khan blinked up at him, confusion furrowing his brows. He wasn’t confused by James’ expression – he was confused by his own actions and feelings. His mind replayed the moment over and over, feeling James’ shirt in his grip, the force of his pull, the scream of the car tires. Something about it felt… off, as if it hadn’t been him moving his body but something else guiding him in that instant the instant he pulled james.</p>

                            <p>Itohan dropped to her knees beside them, pulling both boys into her trembling arms, her tears soaking into their hair as she sobbed silently. The driver hovered nearby, apologising repeatedly as neighbours emerged from their homes, drawn by the commotion.</p>

                            <p>That night, the quiet distance between James and Khan grew wider. James lay on his bed staring at the ceiling, refusing to speak to his brother, his mind replaying the terrifying closeness of death. Khan sat on his own bed, staring at his hands in the dim glow of their bedside lamp, wondering why everything felt so unfamiliar – even his own movements.</p>

                            <p>From that day onwards, Khan became more reserved, his voice softer, his eyes older. He pondered on the memory of that street and the fleeting brush with death. Khan asked himself:</p>

                            <p>I pulled James back…me?</p>

                            <p>Back at the hospital khan wakes up again to all the commotion. He squeezes his face at the memory he just relived.</p>

                        </div>
                        <div class="accordion-panel">
                            <p>It had been a couple of years after the tag incident with James. The family are in nigeria for the holidays, it’s been a while since they last visited. Now sixteen, Khan stood taller, leaner, and sharper than most of his cousins, physically and mentally. The dry Harmattan winds swept through Abuja, coating everything in a thin layer of dust.</p>

                            <p>Cousin Mark and James were planning a house party at one of the family’s many properties in the city. It was a well-kept duplex in a quiet estate, normally used for short-term rentals but reserved during the holidays for family gatherings. The tiled floors gleamed under fresh polish. Framed pictures of the extended Zankali clan hung neatly on the walls. Mark, who lived permanently in Abuja, had been trying to get Khan to engage since his arrival from New York.</p>
                            
                            <p>But Khan had changed. Distant. Focused. seemed obsessed with school, science, and whatever research he never talks about. For two weeks, he disappeared, staying in one of several family-owned apartments and houses scattered across the city. It wasn’t unusual; in a family this well-off, everyone had options.</p>
                            
                            <p>Mark was beginning to worry. He’d promised  his aunt in-law Itohan he would help bring Khan out of his shell this trip. That meant more than just tagging him on photos, she wanted the little kid Khan back. The sometimes funny, intense but curious one. Not this ghost version.</p>
                            
                            <p>Then, one week before the party, Khan reappears. Walks in casually like he hadn’t vanished for two weeks. Surprisingly he was more social this time. Laughing more. Talking more. It was a good sign.</p>
                            
                            <p>Now, on the day before the party, Mark and James were moving crates of drinks into the house with a couple of their friends.</p>
                            
                            <p>Mark says to James “Good thing Khan finally came around. It was starting to feel like he was irritated by us.”</p>
                            
                            <p>James replies “I don’t give a damn. Same thing in New York. He vanishes for days, God knows where, then shows up, smiles for a few days, and goes right back to his psycho routine.”</p>
                            
                            <p>Mark a little bit surprised, responds “That’s funny.”</p>
                            
                            <p>Khan walks in with a case of water bottles.</p>
                            
                            <p>James says to Mark as he stacks bottles on a table “Whatever. At least you’re coming back with us in January. Already set up your room. Uni’s not far from home. But bro, when my dad lets you live on campus, take it. I need somewhere to escape too.”</p>
                            
                            <p>Mark replies “Anything beats schooling in this dump of a country called Nigeria, trust me.”</p>
                            
                            <p>James says “Don’t be so sure. You’ll get the ‘follow me to work, follow me to the library’ treatment from my dad. Every Sunday, I’m in a suit with Mum at church. Meanwhile, Khan stays home watching Discovery Channel or whatever.”</p>
                            
                            <p>Mark unfazed by James complains “Fine by me. Just take me on that city tour when I land. I need Times Square on my story.”</p>
                            
                            <p>James mocking replies “Yeah yeah yeah.”</p>
                            
                            <p>The party day has arrived and it’s evening. The house, already warm with Abuja heat, is packed with bodies and music. Mark, being the magnet he was, had pulled half his high school and neighbors in. Speakers boomed with Afrobeats and trap. Lights were dimmed just right. Perfume, sweat, and the unmistakable scent of weed-laced chocolate, very illegal in the country and also treated like a severe crime by Itohan and her husband Gana.</p>
                            
                            <p>James had to miss it. Food poisoning. He blamed a spicy suya from a roadside joint he tried with Mark. Still, he texted he might show up later.</p>
                            
                            <p>Mark hovered around the house, his phone buzzing every few minutes as he texted Itohan updates about Khan.</p>
                            
                            <p>Khan was… different tonight. Loosened up. Laughing. Holding a drink. Talking to people. Present. Mark watched him for a moment and smiled. Finally.</p>
                            
                            <p>The night wore on. Music got louder. Drinks flowed. People moved from the living room to the kitchen, to the bedrooms. Every room had life in it.</p>
                            
                            <p>Then the energy started to dip. Everyone was becoming slow, maybe due to the weed cake?</p>
                            
                            <p>Bodies slumped into couches, corners, and each other. Some party guest went home, some crashed on mattresses dragged into the living room. A few lay stretched across the tile floor, passed out cold. Too much to drink? Too many edibles? The party had melted into a haze.</p>
                            
                            <p>Khan sat on the ground, his back against the wall, vision blurring. His head was heavy. His chest tight. Everything slowed down. He looked around, Mark passed out beside him, the others laid out across chairs, floors, and laps.</p>
                            
                            <p>It didn’t feel right. Nothing was wrong with the party, it was actually a great success. But he was heavily unsatisfied with something else. something esle was half done within his feelings. it felt like it was mssing the icing on the cake. As Khan pondered, the underwhelming feeling deepened, the feeling of incompletion, and worse off is the feeling of not getting flitting oppotunity that only comes once in a life time. That thought echoed in his mind like a whisper in a cave before his eyes rolled back, and everything went black.</p>
                            
                            <p>Khan looks at the party and everyone sleeping on each other, the chairs and the floor. He feels disgruntled and unsatisfied about the whole process, he feels like something is extremly underwheming like a chance he will never get again before passing out himself.</p>
                            
                            <p>Early morning, the compound swarmed with chaos. Red and blue lights bounced off walls. Sirens screamed. Ambulances. Police. Neighbors shouting. Paramedics moving fast.</p>
                            
                            <p>Eighteen people dead.</p>
                            
                            <p>It’s suspected to be some gas piosoning probably carbon monoxide but from where? The generator was running all night but its a good distance away from the main building which makes it difficult for fumes from the generatr to not just enter but fill the building undetected.</p>
                            
                            <p>James was on-site now, sobbing, holding Mark’s lifeless body in his arms, unable to process what he was seeing. Mark has been pronunced death on the scene. James mother, Itohan, stood nearby, shaking uncontrollably, holding a first responder’s arm for balance.</p>
                            
                            <p>In the back of an ambulance, Khan lay on a stretcher. Barely breathing. Oxygen mask strapped over his face. Somehow, his body had lasted just long enough for him to be saved. Three guests that had left the party early after feeling dizzy. Their return just before sunrise sparked the rescue.</p>
                            
                            <p>Inside the ambulance, Khan’s eyes fluttered open. Blurry shapes, flashing lights, muffled voices.</p>
                            
                            <p>He turned his head slowly. His mother had rushed to him and sat beside him, gripping his hand tightly.</p>
                            
                            <p>“Khan,” she whispered, tears streaking her face. “You’re okay. You’re okay, baby.”</p>
                            
                            <p>Khan’s gaze drifted.</p>
                            
                            <p>On the ground near the house, James was still cradling Mark his suppse new best bud that suppse to hangout together in New York and do all the crazy things they talked about nis now dead, very dead. His shoulders shook with grief, face soaked in tears.</p>
                            
                            <p>Khan and James eyes locked.</p>
                            
                            <p>Khan’s expression was blank, cold, unreadable. James stared at him through swollen eyes, his face twisted with pain. But then… it shifted. His grief paused. His brows furrowed.</p>
                            
                            <p>Confusion had struck James as he looks as Khans face.</p>
                            
                            <p>He looked at Khan not with sorrow, but with something else.</p>
                            
                            <p>Something he couldn’t explain.</p>
                            
                            <p>Something Khan couldn’t either.</p>
                            
                            <p>Not yet.</p>
                            
                            <p>Khan thought to himself in a soft low voice internally "I've been saved" he then looked at his mum and smiles abit. Itohan sees his smile and is conforted thinking he is happy to see her.</p>

                            <p>It’s the present day back at the hospital. The emergency situation had died down and khan and other survivors that were not present in the class but in close vicinity are now in stable condition.</p>

                            <p>The hospital room buzzed with the cold, sterile rhythm of life preservation, machines hissing, beeping, humming. Wires snaked from Khan's body that didn’t look as terrible as it did just some hours ago which surprised doctors a-bit. Oxygen hissed through the mask strapped to his face. Yet beneath the blinking chaos of the trauma ward, Khan smiled.</p>
                            
                            <p>Not the smile of someone grateful to be alive.</p>
                            
                            <p>This was something else.</p>
                            
                            <p>It was the faint curl of a man who had finally solved an impossible riddle. Like a dying scientist who, in his last moments, cracked the formula that had haunted him for years. A kind of euphoria danced just behind his half-lidded eyes, shimmering in his dazed expression. One of the nurses mistook it for pain, leaning in to adjust his morphine levels, unaware that what she was witnessing was Khan’s moment of private revelation.</p>
                            
                            <p>Because now, everything made sense.</p>
                            
                            <p>Khan’s mind slipped backward through time like a reel snapping into reverse. Memories, vivid and raw, began to play.</p>
                            
                            <p>He remembered the basket.</p>
                            
                            <p>The chicks.</p>
                            
                            <p>He wasn’t staring at the drowned chicks that day. He was watching them drown.</p>
                            
                            <p>He was the one who placed the basket in the trough.</p>
                            
                            <p>At six years old, he had quietly tested something, emotion, reaction, weight. He hadn’t felt guilt. He hadn’t felt anything. Just… observation. When James stumbled upon him, screaming for their mother, it wasn’t panic that flared in Khan, it was disappointment. Disappointment that the death of the chicks and how they died did not spark the feeling he was hoping for.</p>
                            
                            <p>Later, in New York, Khan volunteered at the animal shelter, he hadn’t done it to help. He hadn’t done it out of remorse. It was research. He remembered holding trembling dogs, wiping them down, feeding them by hand. People thought he was kind. But Khan remembered how mechanical it had felt. His hands moved, his face smiled. But inside? He was measuring again. Still searching for something that stirred him, and never finding it.He thought maybe if he had developed interest in animals it might have helped him in getting something out of what he did at the chicken farm.</p>
                            
                            <p>His brow tightened faintly on the hospital bed, drawing the attention of a nurse.</p>
                            
                            <p>“Pain spiking, he needs more sedation,” she muttered, prepping another shot.</p>
                            
                            <p>But Khan wasn’t in pain. Not physically.</p>
                            
                            <p>His thoughts shifted.</p>
                            
                            <p>That day in Riverdale. The game of tag. The black sedan.</p>
                            
                            <p>It was supposed to be just another day. But when James broke into the open street, everything slowed. The car barreled toward them, and Khan… he remembered the moment clearly now. The part no one else saw. No one else felt.</p>
                            
                            <p>He had extended his arm, not to save James.</p>
                            
                            <p>To stop him.</p>
                            
                            <p>Just for a second.</p>
                            
                            <p>He wanted to know what would happen.</p>
                            
                            <p>There had been enough space, enough time. James could’ve dodged it. But Khan’s hand blocked the motion. He’d stalled his brother’s movement just long enough for death to reach its tipping point. But at the last second, something pulled him back. Khan’s own hand, yanking James away. Saving him. Regretting it?</p>
                            
                            <p>No.</p>
                            
                            <p>It wasn’t guilt that followed.</p>
                            
                            <p>It was dissatisfaction.</p>
                            
                            <p>He remembered imagining James being hit, and unlike the farm incident the feeling he battled with was not an underwhemling feeling or lack or satisfaction but something esle he couldnt understand. Was it brotherly love? He thought of it as a hinderance. He played it out in his head that night.</p>
                            
                            <p>His eyes opened.</p>
                            
                            <p>The present came rushing back.</p>
                            
                            <p>Family filled the hospital room now. His mother, Itohan, clutched his hand, weeping silently. His father, Gana, stood close behind her, eyes rimmed with exhaustion and pride. Zara, Mark’s younger sister, was seated beside him, her soft fingers brushing his wrist. James stood at the foot of the bed, tired, pale, and relieved.</p>
                            
                            <p>Khan offered them all a smile. A mask.</p>
                            
                            <p>They believed it.</p>
                            
                            <p>James stepped forward, voice cracking with emotion.</p>
                            
                            <p>“I’m so happy you’re alive,” he said. “Doctor said it was a miracle. I heard the police are investigating the explosion… but no one’s claimed responsibility yet.”</p>
                            
                            <p>Gana, Khan's father added, “My son… be strong. You’re alive. That’s all that matters.”</p>
                            
                            <p>Khan nodded faintly. His body was playing along. But inside, another memory surfaced.</p>
                            
                            <p>James leaned in.</p>
                            
                            <p>“I’ve been trying to reach Lanre and Amie all day,” he whispered in a crackling voice reddened with sadness. “Did they… were they in class?”</p>
                            
                            <p>Khan didn’t blink. His voice was a dead echo.</p>
                            
                            <p>“Yes.”</p>
                            
                            <p>James stepped back. His face broke, tears spilling freely.</p>
                            
                            <p>“I, I’m sure the police will find them…” he muttered, half-delusional.</p>
                            
                            <p>Khan replied softly. “They wouldn’t.”</p>
                            
                            <p>James collapsed to the floor, sobbing. His phone trembled in his hand as he scrolled through missed calls. Thirty to Lanre. Fifteen to Amie. Three to Khan.</p>
                            
                            <p>Zara gripped Khan’s hand tighter.</p>
                            
                            <p>Khan turned to her slowly… and the next memory flooded in.</p>
                            
                            <p>The party.</p>
                            
                            <p>Mark, slumped beside him. Breathing ragged.</p>
                            
                            <p>“I don’t feel good,” Mark had whispered. “Khan, something’s wrong. We need to go.”</p>
                            
                            <p>Khan had looked at him. Calm. Clear.</p>
                            
                            <p>“No.”</p>
                            
                            <p>He remembered the setup. Days before the party, he had driven to a house owned by his family. Left the car engine running. Hooked the exhaust into rigged up machine he built. He’d pieced together the rig using supplies bought in parts from hardware stores, auto shops, and online science surplus sites, tubing, metal fittings, a salvaged catalytic unit, and a small compressor system, each item innocent enough on its own. But together, they allowed him to extract the odourless carbon monoxide from the car’s exhaust and channel it silently into heavy-duty storage tanks. He dissasembled the riiged machine after and dumbed all the parts in different land fills and large dumb sites acorss the city. Replaced the normal gas cylinders in the party housewith his new rigged and larger cylinder.</p>
                            
                            <p>The weed cake was a distraction. he had aquired so as to dull the senses of the guest so as not to make anyone panic unnessarily.</p>
                            
                            <p>The windows had been closed.</p>
                            
                            <p>The high would mask the gas.</p>
                            
                            <p>He had watched them fall—one by one. Bodies slumped in chairs, curled on rugs, passed out in corners. He remembered their faces twisting in sleep. He remembered feeling… nothing.</p>
                            
                            <p>That was the disappointment.</p>
                            
                            <p>Even as his own vision blurred, his lungs gasping for clean air, he hadn’t felt anything. No achievement. No meaning.</p>
                            
                            <p>But James hadn’t come. And Khan had felt something flicker, relief? Or the same twisted emotion he felt back in Riverdale? He had laced James’s food to keep him away from the party, crafting the excuse of food poisoning to keep James from the party. He had smiled, watching James eat it. Knowing.</p>
                            
                            <p>Back in the hospital, Khan looked up again.</p>
                            
                            <p>He smiled.</p>
                            
                            <p>A genuine one.</p>
                            
                            <p>Zara returned the smile. His mother cried harder. His father stood proudly.</p>
                            
                            <p>They had no idea.</p>
                            
                            <p>And then came the ecstasy.</p>
                            
                            <p>Pure.</p>
                            
                            <p>Absolute.</p>
                            
                            <p>The memory of the blast.</p>
                            
                            <p>It began as a flicker. A pulse of light, warm and golden, blooming from the very center of Khan’s desk, his original seat, like a heartbeat made of flame. In that frozen instant, time fractured into fragments, and Khan’s mind shattered the moment into nanoseconds, pulling every detail into sharp, breathtaking focus.</p>
                            
                            <p>From the back of the class where he now sat, where faith had reluctantly placed him, he watched it unfold.</p>
                            
                            <p>The fire didn't explode outward. It breathed. First in silence, then with a rolling growl that shook the windows. The desk itself was gone in a blink, splintered into sparks and shrapnel as a brilliant white-hot orb of gas expanded like a supernova. Light bent, shadows danced. Heat warped the air into a liquid shimmer.</p>
                            
                            <p>Lanre sat directly in front of the blast, mid-laugh, his lips just parting around a joke Khan would never hear the end of. In a single instant, the front of his shirt disintegrated, followed by his skin, bone, and soul. His eyes, wide with surprise and something almost serene, locked with Khan’s, then vanished in a stream of embers.</p>
                            
                            <p>Amie turned toward the blast too late, her blonde hair lifting with the air pressure. Her eyes caught his—soft, puzzled, blinking once as if unsure whether she was still awake. Then the flames kissed her face, curling her features in molten bloom before she was swept away in orange light.</p>
                            
                            <p>They both smiled.</p>
                            
                            <p>In that final frame before the fire consumed them, they smiled at him. As if they knew.</p>
                            
                            <p>The fire danced around them like an artist’s brushstroke, then moved on, hungry, elegant, precise. The explosion surged outward, engulfing three students seated nearby. One threw up his hands too late, his voice caught in his throat as the fire bit through his desk and swallowed his torso. Another stood, but the wave of heat shattered her limbs before neurons from her body could tell her brain what’s happening. Her silhouette burned against the whiteboard behind her for a split second, then disappeared.</p>
                            
                            <p>Next was Professor Robbin with his big smile facing the class as the fire ball approached was slowly in Khans eyes incinerated. Khan saw him show no sign of pain, movement or even awareness of what was happening to him. This was a euphoric moment for Khan.</p>
                            
                            <p>On to the next one, four students near the windows, were tossed like rag dolls as glass shattered in a brilliant chorus. Their bodies slammed into the wall, hair and clothes ignited mid-air like meteors. Flames curled around them as the room filled with the flame.</p>
                            
                            <p>Chairs flew. Desks became shrapnel. One student near the door clutched the handle, trying to open it, but the wood itself had caught fire, and his skin fused to the metal before he crumpled. Another, crawling beneath a desk, was caught in the rising surge.</p>
                            
                            <p>Khan saw it all.</p>
                            
                            <p>Saw the bones, the ash, the tears evaporating off cheeks before they could fall. Saw fingers stretching out mid-reach, mid-scream. A constellation of death unfolding around him.</p>
                            
                            <p>He felt no panic. Only rapture.</p>
                            
                            <p>The blast wave rolled toward him in slow motion, a monstrous, golden tsunami. It painted the classroom in fire, layer by layer, first light, then heat, then devastation. And he, the happy spectator at the edge of the world, absorbed it all through wide, unblinking eyes.</p>
                            
                            <p>The air turned into blades, hurling glass and steel. The floor buckled beneath him, groaning as its core was torn apart. Bodies flung against the ceiling collapsed in flames. Blood vaporized before it could hit the ground.</p>
                            
                            <p>And then the fire reached him.</p>
                            
                            <p>It kissed his skin, peeled away the first layer like silk. Pain should have come, but it didn’t. All he felt was light, burning, beautiful light, as his body arched back, arms wide open, as if welcoming it. Welcoming the conclusion of the symphony he had composed.</p>
                            
                            <p>In that final moment, as the fire crowned around him, folding him into its embrace like a god returning to the stars, he smiled. Not from joy. Not from relief. But from a deep, perfect knowing, like a truth that had eluded him all his life had finally unveiled itself in that consuming blaze.</p>
                            
                            <p>It was not chaos.</p>
                            
                            <p>It was art. a beutiful art months in preperation.</p>
                            
                            <p>And he was the artist, lost in the masterpiece he had painted with flesh and fire.</p>
                            
                            <p>Back in the room, he sat up slightly. Reached for Zara. Pulled James from the floor and embraced him too. His family leaned in, surrounding him with warmth and relief.</p>
                            
                            <p>Then Khan lay back, whispered:</p>
                            
                            <p>“I can do this again.”</p>
                            
                            <p>A single tear rolled from his eye. The first his parents had ever seen from him.</p>
                            
                            <p>And they smiled.</p>
                            
                            <p>They thought he was healing.</p>
                            
                            <p>They had no idea.</p>
